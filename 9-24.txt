create a user object, data access object, get comment, etc (be thinking about this)
you can create classes just like in Java in php
$render->renderTable("icecream.data") this is how we instantiate an object
make functions good at doing a small amount of things
class foo{ (this makes a class just like any other OOP thing)
}
find all the places with html and php that are  mangled together and pull them out into classes

constuctor in php is __construct (these are magic methods) use normally construct/toString
this-> file = $file; (to pass in variable)

using the class echo Calculator::add(5, 10) . "/n";

abstract class- makes an abstract class

have a DAO class which makes things easier and more consistent

serialize-"deflates" the object...object has been turned into a string, this can make things portable but uselss (like a deflated beach ball)
json-best way to send data between languages

Find answers in php lecture slides


GET/POST/FORMS
after the q= this is the query string
forms are logins,check e-mails, buy stuff, etc
this ties the front end to the back end
